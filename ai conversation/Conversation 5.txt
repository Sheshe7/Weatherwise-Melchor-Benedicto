Date:21-05-2025


Me:  I used an API-key to access a weather data soruce and i received all the weather data available there however, i want to know the prompt or code that can enable me to test that weather data API.

AI: Great! If you've received all the weather data successfully using your API key, and now you want to test that API (i.e., verify it's working correctly, handles errors gracefully, returns valid data), you can do this using a test script or prompts in Python.

✅ What You Likely Want To Test
✅ API connectivity – is the API reachable?

✅ API key validity – is the key correct?

✅ Response structure – is the JSON structured as expected?

✅ Error handling – what happens when city names or coordinates are wrong?

✅ Rate limits – does it handle "too many requests"?

✅ Simple Python Script to Test Your Weather API
Here’s a minimal test script using only requests to test the API's basic functionality:

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

def test_weather_api(api_key, location='London'):
    base_url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
    params = {
        'q': location,
        'appid': api_key,
        'units': 'metric'
    }

    try:
        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise error for bad status codes
        data = response.json()

        # Check if key fields exist
        assert 'main' in data, "Missing 'main' section"
        assert 'weather' in data, "Missing 'weather' section"
        assert 'wind' in data, "Missing 'wind' section"

        print("✅ API Test Passed!")
        print(f"City: {data['name']}")
        print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']} °C")
        print(f"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description']}")
        print(f"Wind Speed: {data['wind']['speed']} m/s")

    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        print(f"❌ HTTP Error: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"❌ Request Failed: {e}")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"❌ Data Structure Error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Unexpected Error: {e}")

# Example usage
api_key = "your_actual_api_key_here"
test_weather_api(api_key, location="Mauritius")
🧪 Advanced Test Ideas
Test Scenario	What to Do
❌ Invalid API key	Change API key to an incorrect string
❌ Invalid city name	Use gibberish like "asdfgh"
🌍 Coordinate test	Use lat and lon instead of q
🔁 Rate limit test	Loop 100+ calls quickly (careful – might block)
🧪 Mock response test (for dev)	Use unittest.mock to simulate API responses

✅ Using Curl or Postman (Optional)
If you're not using Python, you can test via curl:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=your_api_key&units=metric"
Or use Postman:

Set the endpoint to: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather

Add query params: q=London, appid=your_api_key, units=metric

✅ Summary Prompt for API Testing
If you're looking for a general-purpose code prompt:

Write a Python script that sends a test request to the OpenWeatherMap API using a given API key, verifies the response structure, and prints key weather details or meaningful error messages.


Me: Your provided code says that i must use def test_weather_api(api_key, location='London'); I would like to know if there is a different code where i am not requested to enter the location since the scraping already provides it. 

AI: Yes — absolutely! If you've already scraped or retrieved the location programmatically, and you don’t want the function to ask for a city name again, you can pass the location as an argument from your scraping logic, or even embed it directly in the test logic.

Let’s break this down with a practical version of the code tailored for your situation:

✅ Situation:
You already have a city name, or latitude and longitude from previous scraping or another function.

You want to test the weather API using that data, without being prompted again for input.

✅ Solution 1: Use Pre-Filled Location from Scraping
🧩 Example Code:
python
Copy
Edit
import requests

def test_weather_api_with_scraped_location(api_key, location_data):
    """
    location_data: can be a string (e.g., city name) or a dict with lat/lon.
    Example:
        location_data = "Mauritius"
        or
        location_data = {"lat": -20.3484, "lon": 57.5522}
    """
    base_url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
    params = {
        'appid': api_key,
        'units': 'metric'
    }

    # Dynamically build params from location data
    if isinstance(location_data, str):
        params['q'] = location_data
    elif isinstance(location_data, dict) and 'lat' in location_data and 'lon' in location_data:
        params['lat'] = location_data['lat']
        params['lon'] = location_data['lon']
    else:
        print("❌ Invalid location format.")
        return

    try:
        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()

        print("✅ Weather API Test Passed!")
        print(f"Location: {data.get('name')} ({data.get('sys', {}).get('country', 'N/A')})")
        print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}°C")
        print(f"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description'].title()}")
        print(f"Wind Speed: {data['wind']['speed']} m/s")

    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        print(f"❌ HTTP Error: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"❌ Request Failed: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Unexpected Error: {e}")

# ✅ Example: assume this came from your scraping logic
scraped_location = {"lat": -20.2659, "lon": 57.4791}  # Example: Quatre Bornes, Mauritius
api_key = "your_actual_api_key_here"

# Test with scraped data
test_weather_api_with_scraped_location(api_key, scraped_location)
✅ Notes
Input Type	What to Provide
City name	"Mauritius"
Lat/Lon	{"lat": -20.3, "lon": 57.5}


Me: If i requested data from a source using scraping instead of an API key, how can i test the integrity of that information i just retrieved.


AI: Excellent question — verifying the integrity of scraped data is crucial because scraping is prone to unexpected changes in structure, missing elements, or incorrect values.

Here's a structured approach to test and validate the integrity of data retrieved via web scraping:

✅ 1. Define What "Integrity" Means for Your Data
Depending on your goal (e.g., weather data), integrity checks might include:

Field	Expected Type	Example Integrity Rule
Temperature	float or int	Must be within reasonable range (e.g., -90°C to 60°C)
Humidity	int	Between 0 and 100
City name	str	Should not be empty or contain numbers
Date/time	str or datetime	Must match a known format

✅ 2. Use Assertions or Checks in Code
Here's a reusable Python function to check scraped weather data integrity:

python
Copy
Edit
def validate_scraped_weather(data):
    """
    Validates the integrity of scraped weather data.
    Expects a dictionary with keys like: 'city', 'temperature', 'humidity', 'weather_desc'
    """

    try:
        assert isinstance(data, dict), "Data must be a dictionary."

        # Required keys
        required_keys = ['city', 'temperature', 'humidity', 'weather_desc']
        for key in required_keys:
            assert key in data, f"Missing key: {key}"

        # Type checks
        assert isinstance(data['city'], str) and data['city'].strip(), "City must be a non-empty string."
        assert isinstance(data['temperature'], (int, float)), "Temperature must be a number."
        assert isinstance(data['humidity'], int), "Humidity must be an integer."
        assert isinstance(data['weather_desc'], str), "Weather description must be a string."

        # Logical value ranges
        assert -90 <= data['temperature'] <= 60, "Temperature out of valid range."
        assert 0 <= data['humidity'] <= 100, "Humidity must be between 0 and 100."

        print("✅ Data integrity test passed.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"❌ Data integrity error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Unexpected error during validation: {e}")
✅ Example: Use It Like This
python
Copy
Edit
# Example of scraped data
scraped_weather = {
    "city": "Mauritius",
    "temperature": 28.5,
    "humidity": 75,
    "weather_desc": "clear sky"
}

# Validate
validate_scraped_weather(scraped_weather)
✅ 3. Add Redundancy Checks (Optional)
Compare scraped data to:

Another scraping source

API data (if available)

Known expected values (e.g., from yesterday)

✅ 4. Log or Alert on Failures
If this is part of a larger app or data pipeline:

Log failures to a file

Save raw HTML response for debugging

Notify via email or webhook if something breaks

✅ 5. Automate Tests with Unit Testing
Use unittest or pytest to validate scraped results automatically in test files.

python
Copy
Edit
import unittest

class TestWeatherScraping(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_temperature_range(self):
        data = {"temperature": 50}
        self.assertTrue(-90 <= data['temperature'] <= 60)
✅ Summary: Scraped Data Integrity Checklist
Check Type	What to Check
Structure	Are required fields present?
Type	Are values the correct data types?
Logic	Are numbers within real-world ranges?
Format	Is text clean (e.g., city name isn't numbers)?
Stability	Does the site layout change between runs?
