## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?

To complete this assignment, I decided to use two AI tools to ensure that I would have all the necessary information available. The AI tools that I used are ChatGPT and Deepseek. Using two tools has helped me to have, in one click, all the information I needed, plus the tools have enabled me to compare and balance different answers and codes that were provided, so I could decide which one would suit my Weather app. Some of the clear aspects in which these AI helped me are:
•	They provided up-to-date information. 
•	Robust code implementation. 
•	Data retrieval and error handling features. 
•	The AI also advised me in a specific area of improvement. 
•	Well-coded user interface. 


## Prompting Techniques

As a prompting technique, I used generated knowledge. I prompted AI with an initial question, and the answers were provided, so I continued asking for additional information related to the first prompt.  I also used self-refine prompting, whereby I was evaluating the problem and asking for solutions. 

## What Worked Well?


One of the things I am proud of is that I identified an error in the AI-provided code. In the code, there was no exit or break after the for loop, so the program was asking the same thing over and over.  The issue was located at the end of the code; therefore, I simply added *break* to terminate the loop and after that, everything worked perfectly.

 
## What Would You Do Differently?

If I had more time, I would have changed the User interface. It seems to me that the UI was so simple, and it lacked options such as selecting a language so that the program could be useful for international users. Plus, in the initial fragment of code, I would add the insert API-KEY.   

## Final Thoughts

My learning experience has been enlightening, using two AI tools has exposed me to different scenarios, I could visualise the strengths and weaknesses of each one. Completing this assignment has helped me to know the modules and code I could use to access a source of data, whether with an API key or not. I view the data error handling techniques, the natural language implementation and timeout handling in the AI codes, which broadens my knowledge in code manipulation techniques.    

I would like to conclude stating that by being in the field and put into practice your your knowledge we learn more than just living with theorical
